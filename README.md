# LeetCode

I'm going to practice LeetCode starting with the Neetcode 150 list. As I complete each problem, I'll update the NeetCode 150.xlsx and add my solution in the respective folder.

## My LeetCode Strategy

- Start with the Neetcode 150 list to cover the most important patterns and problem types.
- Focus on understanding patterns (sliding window, two pointers, binary search, etc.) rather than just memorizing solutions.
- For each problem:
  1. Read and understand the problem statement fully.
  2. Try to solve it on my own before looking at hints or solutions.
  3. If stuck, review similar problems or patterns.
  4. Write clean, well-commented code and test with edge cases.
  5. After solving, review the official and top community solutions to learn new tricks or optimizations.
- Update the tracker after each problem and organize solutions by topic/folder.
- Regularly revisit previously solved problems to reinforce learning and improve speed.
